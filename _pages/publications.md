You can find my complete list of publications on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=bourdenx+mathieu&sort=date). Below, I selected several publications. 

Tau and Proteostasis
===
My recent work as post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo focuses on chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in the context of aging and tauopathies. 


[Chaperone-mediated autophagy prevents collapse of the neuronal metastable proteome](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.048). Here, we first described the consequences of CMA failure to neuronal proteostasis. Then, we characterized the dysfunction of CMA in a model of tau pathology and correlated it with observation made in data from Alzheimer's disease patients. We demonstrated that CMA is not only inhibited in disease but also contributes to disease progression by aggravating key aspect of the pathology. Last, we showed, using a first-in-class small molecule, that targeting CMA could be of interest in tauopathies. This publication is also described in a shorter version [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1935007).

[Acetylated tau inhibits chaperone-mediated autophagy and promotes tau pathology propagation in mice](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22501-9). In this publication, we focused on the consequences of tau's acetylation to its degradation. Interestingly, we observed that acetylated tau is not only a poor CMA substrate but it also blocks CMA, therefore preventing other substrates from being timely degraded. In absence of degradation through CMA, tau is re-routed to other pathways including endosomal-microautophagy, that could contribute to its extracellular release. In fact, experimental blockage of CMA enhances cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic tau.
