Hello World! I am a junior researcher interested in neuroscience in general and neurodegeneration in particular. I am currently working at the [UK Dementia Research Institute](https://ukdri.ac.uk/) in University College London, London (United Kingdom). 

My current work focuses on **tauopathies** (a group of diseases comprising Alzheimer's disease) and more generally how **proteostasis** impairments are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. By combining various methods ranging from molecular biology to computational neuroscience, I investigate the **pathogenic mechanisms** underlying the onset and progression of these dramatic diseases. Here are some example of questions I am currently working on: 

* What is the molecular basis for the heterogeneity in tauopathies?
* How does pathogenic proteins propagate in the brain? 
* Why are some brain cells/regions particularly vulnerable to pathogenic proteins?
