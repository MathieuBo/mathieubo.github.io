Hello World! I am a junior researcher interested in neuroscience in general and neurodegeneration in particular. I am currently working at the [Institut des Maladies Neurodegeneratives](https://www.imn-bordeaux.org) in Bordeaux (France). 

My current work focuses on tauopathies (a group of diseases comprising Alzheimer's disease) and more generally how proteostasis impairments are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. By combining various methods ranging from molecular biology to computational neuroscience, I investigate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of these dramatic diseases. Here are some example of questions I am currently working on: 

* What is the molecular basis for the heterogeneity in tauopathies?
* How does pathogenic proteins propagate in the brain? 
* Why are some brain cells/regions particularly vulnerable to pathogenic proteins?
